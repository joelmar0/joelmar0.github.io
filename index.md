## Welcome to My Website

Hi my name is Joel Martin, I am a senior at Iowa State University pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Data Science with an emphasis in Big Data.

### Experience

I am familiar with a few different coding languages. These include R, Python, SQL, Java, C, HTML, and CSS. I have also obtained my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications.

In my coursework I participated in a number of [online judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) projects. In these projects you are given a problem and are then required to develop an algorithm using Java, C, or C++. For the class I took we used C for all the project submission.

One of these problems was 10608 - [Friends](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=1549). In this probelm we were given a number of cases where person A is friends with person B, a town with N citizens, and M pairs of known friends where there could be repititions. We were then tasked to find the largest group of friends and return the size of that group.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/joelmar0/joelmar0.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
