## Welcome to My Website

Hi, my name is Joel Martin; I am a senior at Iowa State University pursuing my Bachelors's Degree in Data Science with an emphasis in Big Data. My anticipated graduation date is December 2022, in which I would like to begin working in the Data Engineering field.

### Experience

I am familiar with a few different coding languages. These include R, Python, SQL, Java, C, HTML, and CSS. I have also obtained my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications.

In my coursework, I participated in several online judge projects. Online Judge is a website used for fun and competitions where users are given a problem and must develop an algorithm using Java, C, or C++ to complete the task as quickly as possible. We used C for all the project submissions for the class I took.

One of these problems was 10608 - Friends. In this problem, we were given an N number of citizens in a town, M pairs of known friends where there could be repetitions, and K number of cases where person A is friends with person B. We were then tasked to find the largest group of friends and return the size of that group.

Another coursework project I worked on was given a companies proposal and requirements for a database work through the steps needed to create the database. These steps included drafting an entity-relationship diagram to match the needs of the companies database. Creating the database in SQL. Populating the database with the given CSV file of data being sure to catch cases where the data was messy. And finally, running some basic queries on the database for the company.
