## Welcome to My Website

Hi my name is Joel Martin, I am a senior at Iowa State University pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Data Science with an emphasis in Big Data. My anticipated graduation date is December 2022

### Experience

I am familiar with a few different coding languages. These include R, Python, SQL, Java, C, HTML, and CSS. I have also obtained my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications.

In my coursework I participated in a number of [online judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) projects. In these projects you are given a problem and are then required to develop an algorithm using Java, C, or C++. For the class I took we used C for all the project submission.

One of these problems was 10608 - [Friends](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=1549). In this problem we were given an N number citizens in a town, M pairs of known friends where there could be repititions, and K number of cases where person A is friends with person B. We were then tasked to find the largest group of friends and return the size of that group by developing C code to complete the task in as quickly as possible using techniques we learned from previous and current classes.

Another coursework project I worked on was given a companies proposal and requirements for a database, work through the steps needed to create the database. These steps included drafting an entity relationship diagram to match the needs of the companies database. Creating the database in SQL. Populating the database with the given csv file of data being sure to catch cases where the data was messy. And finally running some basic queries on the database for the company.
